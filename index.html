                           European Championship, the quadrennial international men's football championship of Europe organized by UEFA. It is 
                           scheduled to be held in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016. Spain are two-time defending champions.
                           For the first time, the European Championship final tournament will be contested by 24 teams, having been 
                           expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996. Under this new format, the finalists will contest a group stage 
                           consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout stage including three rounds and the final. 19 teams 
                           joined France who qualified automatically as hosts. A two-legged play-off in November 2015 decided the last four spots 
                           at the final tournament.

                           <p>France was chosen as the host on 28 May 2010, after a bidding process in which they beat Italy and Turkey for 
                              the right to host the 2016 finals. The matches will be played in ten stadia in ten cities: Bordeaux, Lens, Lille, 
                              Lyon, Marseille, Nice, Paris, Saint-Denis, Saint-Étienne, and Toulouse. It will be the third time that France hosts 
                              the tournament, after the inaugural tournament in 1960 and the 1984 finals. The French team have won the European 
                              Championship twice: in 1984 and 2000.</p>

                     Denmark and Greece have won one title each. To date, Spain are the only side in history to 
                     have won consecutive titles, doing so in the 2008 and 2012 editions. It is the 2nd most
